* Cross-site scripting vulnerabilities normally allow an attacker to masquerade as a victim user, to carry out any actions that the user is able to perform, and to access any of the user's data. 
- If the victim user has privileged access within the application, then the attacker might be able to gain full control over all of the application's functionality and data.


## How does XSS work?

Cross-site scripting works by manipulating a vulnerable web site so that it returns malicious JavaScript to users. When the malicious code executes inside a victim's browser, the attacker can fully compromise their interaction with the application

## Types of XSS attacks

1. Reflected XSS, where the malicious script comes from the current HTTP request.
2. Stored XSS, where the malicious script comes from the website's database.
3. DOM-based XSS, where the vulnerability exists in client-side code rather than server-side code.
