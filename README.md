## SQL Injection

1. __SQL injection (SQLi) is a web security vulnerability that allows an attacker to interfere with the queries that an application makes to its database. __**
2. An attacker can modify or delete this data, causing persistent changes to the application's content or behavior.
3. can escalate a SQL injection attack to compromise the underlying server or other back-end infrastructure, or perform a denial-of-service attack.
4.  SQL injection attack can result in unauthorized access to sensitive data, such as passwords, credit card details, or personal user information (PII). 


*How to detect SQL Injection vulnerabilities*
+ majority of SQL injection vulnerabilities can be found quickly using Burp Suite's web vulnerability scanner.
-  can be detected manually by using a systematic set of tests against every entry point in the application
1. Submitting the single quote character '
2. Boolean conditions such as OR 1=1 and OR 1=2
3. payloads designed to trigger time delays when executed within a SQL query, and looking for differences in the time taken to respond.
4. OAST(out of band application security testing) payloads designed to trigger an out-of-band network interaction when executed within a SQL query, and monitoring for any resulting interactions.
5. SQL-specific syntax that evaluates to the base (original) value of the entry point, and to a different value, and looking for systematic differences in the resulting application responses.



*Most SQL injection vulnerabilities arise within the WHERE clause of a SELECT query.*

+ The most common other locations where SQL injection arises are in Update,  Select, Insert tatements and orderby, where clauses.

Some common SQL injection examples include:

+ Retrieving hidden data, where you can modify a SQL query to return additional results.
- Subverting application logic, where you can change a query to interfere with the application's logic.
+ UNION attacks, where you can retrieve data from different database tables.
- Blind SQL injection, where the results of a query you control are not returned in the application's responses.

__double-dash sequence -- is a comment indicator in SQL, and means that the rest of the query is interpreted as a comment.__
SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = 'Gifts'--' AND released = 1

__Since 1=1 is always true, the query will return all items.__
SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = 'Gifts' OR 1=1--' AND released = 1
